"""
Contains components that prepare, execute, and read output from DIF3D.

Anything wanting DIF3D results should instantiate these objects and use them.
The objects here are intended to be short lived e.g. created, used, and destroyed.

The ``Dif3dExecuter`` orchestrates the tasks of interpreting relevant case settings,
writing a DIF3D input file, executing DIF3D upon that file, and reading the resultant
DIF3D output files back in. The results read from the output files are then applied to
the reactor model. In addition to dealing specifically with DIF3D itself, this
sub-classes the :py:class:`GlobalFluxExecuter
<armi:armi.physics.neutronics.globalFlux.globalFluxInterface.GlobalFluxExecuter>`, which
assists in performing geometry transformations, flux-based parameter computation, and
other tasks.
